    "Basketball is a globally renowned sport with a massive following, and the professional leagues are the pinnacle of talent and competition. Understanding player statistics is essential for team management, player evaluation, and fan engagement. The \"all_seasons\" dataset captures data that outlines the performance of basketball players across various seasons. Using this dataset, our predictive question could be, for instance, how a player's attributes relate to their on-court performance? The dataset encompasses several key attributes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- player_name\n",
    "- team_abbreviation\n",
    "- age\n",
    "- player_height\n",
    "- player_weight\n",
    "- college\n",
    "- country\n",
    "- draft_year\n",
    "- draft_round\n",
    "- points per game (pts)\n",
    "- rebounds per game (reb)\n",
    "- assists per game (ast)\n",
    "- net_rating\n",
    "- offensive rebound percentage (oreb_pct)\n",
    "- defensive rebound percentage (dreb_pct)\n",
    "- usage percentage (usg_pct)\n",
    "- true shooting percentage (ts_pct)\n",
    "- assist percentage (ast_pct)\n",
    "- season\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this dataset, we aim to draw insights and patterns from player statistics, potentially aiding in the selection, trading, and performance prediction of players in various basketball seasons."
